# Global-EV-Sales-2010---2024
<h1>Global EV Dataset Analysis</h1>

<p>This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (<em>Global EV Sales Analysis.ipynb</em>) that performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to global electric vehicle (EV) sales, stocks, and trends over the years 2010-2024, along with sales projections from 2024-2035. The analysis explores EV sales and stock trends globally, including Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs), and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). It also examines the growth of EV sales and the distribution of different powertrain types across various regions.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has been a significant trend in the global automotive industry, driven by the need for sustainable transportation and the reduction of carbon emissions. This analysis aims to understand the patterns and trends in the EV market by examining sales data, stock information, and projections across different regions and vehicle types.</p>

<h3>Key Questions Explored in This Analysis</h3>

<p>Throughout this EDA, we aim to answer the following key questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are the global trends in EV sales from 2010 to 2024?</li>
  <li>Which regions have shown the highest growth in EV adoption, and what factors contribute to this growth?</li>
  <li>How do different powertrain types (BEVs, FCEVs, PHEVs) compare in terms of market share and growth over time?</li>
  <li>What are the projected trends for EV sales and stocks from 2024 to 2035?</li>
  <li>How does the distribution of EV powertrain types vary across different regions?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dataset Description</h2>

<p>The dataset consists of 12,654 entries with 8 columns, providing information on electric vehicles (EVs) across various regions and categories. Here's a brief overview of the columns in the dataset:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>region:</strong> The geographical region or country.</li>
  <li><strong>category:</strong> The data category, such as historical data or projections.</li>
  <li><strong>parameter:</strong> Specific parameters being measured, such as EV stock, EV stock share, or EV sales share.</li>
  <li><strong>mode:</strong> The type of vehicles considered, such as cars.</li>
  <li><strong>powertrain:</strong> The powertrain type, like Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs), and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).</li>
  <li><strong>year:</strong> The year the data was recorded.</li>
  <li><strong>unit:</strong> The units of measurement, e.g., vehicles, percent.</li>
  <li><strong>value:</strong> The numeric values corresponding to the parameter being measured.</li>
</ul>

<p>The dataset includes data from the year 2010 to 2035. The <strong>value</strong> column, which appears to be the primary metric of interest, spans a wide range, suggesting a diverse set of measurements from percentages to actual vehicle counts. The data covers various aspects of the EV market, including sales, market share, and overall stock.</p>
